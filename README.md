## App Description

This Flutter app uses the Material Design framework to create a simple, yet elegant, portfolio. The app consists of the following components:

1. Profile Picture: A circular avatar displays my profile picture, giving a glimpse of who I am.

2. Name and Profession: My full name, "Karan Singh Rana," is displayed with a custom font (Pacifico) to add a personal touch. Below the name, my profession, "DEVELOPER," is highlighted using a different font (SourceSans).

3. Contact Details: Two cards display my contact information. One card shows my phone number, and the other displays my email address. Both cards use a custom font (karan) and have an icon on the left to represent the contact type (phone or email).

4. Divider: A horizontal divider separates my name and profession from the contact details, adding visual clarity to the layout.
